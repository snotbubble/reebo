1. (unresolved) redbin_vs_intparam : attempt to track-down the cause of a missing int param in rebo.red after data is reloaded from binary
2. (resolved, but not happy) redbin_vs_func : saving to binary 'collapses' a function inside a context (object), resulting in incorrect output, solution is to pre-mold it, load and do-do it, out of context, with args.
